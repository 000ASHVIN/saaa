                    <h4>COURSE METHOD & DELIVERY:</h4>
                    <p>Rather than attending a formal review engagement extended CPD training course and paying the course fee, a practitioner is now able to combine their extensive experience as accountants in practice with their current knowledge of client engagements and self-study efforts to take and pass the exam for a Practicing Licence to perform the Independent Review.</p>
                    <p>SAIBA is a recognised independent accountancy professional body as envisaged in the Companies Act, 2008 and Companies Regulations, 2011, whose members are qualified to be appointed as accounting officers for Close Corporations in terms of section 60 of the Close Corporations Act, 1984 (Act No. 69 of 1984). According to the Companies Regulations, 2011 this recognition entitles SAIBA members to perform the mandatory independent review for non-owner managed companies with a public interest score of below 100 points. In addition SAIBA members may perform voluntary review engagements for audit exempt owner-managed companies. The Practicing licence regime will be used by SAIBA as motivation to obtain recognition for performing independent reviews at the 100 - 350 public interest score level.</p>
                    <p>Regulation 29(12) of the Companies Regulations 2011 requires that SAIBA establish and maintain proper mechanisms to ensure that its members achieve professional competence with regard to review engagements. This is achieved by providing recognition for prior experience and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>SAIBA recognises that many practitioners:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have extensive experience in preparing working papers as accounting officers,</li>
                        <li>Assist auditors with the preparation of working papers for audit clients,</li>
                        <li>Obtained their training under the supervision of registered auditors,</li>
                        <li>Already attended a CPD or training course in review engagements, and have already obtained verifiable and non-verifiable CPD hours relevant to review engagements</li>
                    </ul>
