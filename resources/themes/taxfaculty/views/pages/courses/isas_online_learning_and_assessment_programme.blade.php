                    <h4>Assessment:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The ISAs learning and assessment programme is self-taught and is assessed online in an ‘open book’ environment where the official standards and other suitable publications can be used. Candidates will have a time limit of 100 minutes to complete the online assessment and must achieve a score of 60% in order to pass. The assessment comprises 50 multiple-choice test questions drawn from a bank of many hundred such questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Candidates can take the assessment at any time - and as often as they wish - during their 12 month registration period.
                        The assessment is available online (please see recommended system requirements below) and is accessed using a unique login code that is provided to each candidate when they register. Upon successful completion of the online assessment, candidates will be able to immediately download and print off a personalised ICAEW certificate which demonstrates their successful completion of the programme.
                    </p>

                        The exact time required to prepare for and pass the ICAEW ISAs learning and assessment programme is dependent on the candidate’s prior knowledge and experience of ISAs but is estimated to be the equivalent of 40 to 50 hours of full-time study on average.

                        Exam preparation can be done using the official ICAEW self-study materials that are provided upon registration. Candidates are also free to prepare for the ISAs learning and assessment programme in any other manner that they choose.
