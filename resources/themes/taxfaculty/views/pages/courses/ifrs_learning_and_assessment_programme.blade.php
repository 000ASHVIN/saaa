                    <h4>Assessment:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The IFRSs learning and assessment programme is self-taught and is assessed online in an ‘open
                        book’ environment where the official IASB standards and other suitable publications can be used.
                        Candidates will have a time limit of 2 hours to complete the online assessment, and must achieve
                        a score of 60% in order to pass. The assessment comprises 60 multiple-choice test questions
                        drawn from a bank of many hundred such questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Candidates can take the assessment at any time - and as often as they wish - during their 12
                        month registration period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The assessment is available online (please see recommended system requirements below) and is
                        accessed using a unique login code that is provided to each candidate when they register. Upon
                        successful completion of the online assessment, candidates will be able to immediately download
                        and print off a personalised ICAEW certificate which demonstrates successful completion of the
                        programme.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Preparation and study: </h4>
                    <p>
                        The exact time required to study for the ICAEW Certificate in IFRS is dependent on the
                        candidate’s prior knowledge and experience of IFRS but is estimated to be the equivalent of 70
                        hours of full-time study on average.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exam preparation can be done using the official ICAEW self-study materials that are provided
                        upon registration. Candidates are also free to prepare for the ICAEW Certificate in IFRS in any
                        other manner that they choose.
                    </p>
