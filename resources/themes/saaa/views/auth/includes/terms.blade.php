                    a. If the subscriber has opted for the 'EFT' / 'Instant EFT' method of payment, he/she will receive
                    an invoice for the annual amount which needs to be paid as a single instalment. If the subscriber
                    wishes to pay off the annual amount over a period of 12 months, he/she has the option to pay by
                    Credit card or by debit order only. Credit card/debit order payments will be automatically deducted
                    on a monthly basis.

                <p>
                    b. CPD subscribers will be able to join all two-hour webinars through their profile page, so there
                    is no need to register for them. Recordings of the webinars will be made available for viewing to
                    all subscribers within 5 working days of the date of the webinar.

                    for the seminar at least a week in advance so that we can advise the venue of our expected delegate
                    numbers and to accommodate any dietary requirements. If the subscriber does not register and attend,
                    a recording of the event and CPD assessment will automatically be made available via the
                    subscriber's profile page.

                    registering and not attending without prior cancellation. At least 48 (forty-eight) hours' notice
                    must be given.

                <p>
                    e. We cannot guarantee that every seminar will be hosted at all venues and if the subscriber is
                    unable to attend an event or it is not available in his/her area, he/she has the option of attending
                    a webinar for that event. If the date of the webinar is not convenient, then a recording of the
                    event and CPD assessment will be made available as per c. above.

                <p>
                    f. If an event in the subscriber's area for which he/she has registered is cancelled, then the
                    recording will be made available as per c. above, unless the subscriber wishes to attend the event
                    in another area, in which case he/she must notify us in writing by emailing admin@accountingacademy
                    .co.za at least 3 (three) days prior to the event taking place.

                    he/she can request a copy of the recording on DVD by emailing admin@accountingacademy.co.za. Please
                    note DVDs will only be available 4 - 6 weeks after the seminar has taken place. This service will
                    incur an additional R150 courier fee.
