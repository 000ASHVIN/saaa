                    <h4>Assessment:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The ICAEW IFRS for SMEs learning and assessment programme is self-taught and is assessed online
                        in an ‘open book’ environment where the official standards and other suitable publications can
                        be used. Candidates will have a time limit of 80 minutes to complete the online assessment and
                        must achieve a score of 55% in order to pass. The assessment comprises 40 multiple-choice test
                        questions drawn from a bank of many hundred such questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Candidates can take the assessment at any time - and as often as they wish - during their 12
                        month registration period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The assessment is available online (please see recommended system requirements below) and is
                        accessed using a unique login code that is provided to each candidate when they register. Upon
                        successful completion of the online assessment, candidates will be able to immediately download
                        and print off a personalised ICAEW certificate which demonstrates their successful completion of
                        the programme.
