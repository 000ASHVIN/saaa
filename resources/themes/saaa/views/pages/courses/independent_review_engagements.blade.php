                   <h4>OVERVIEW:</h4>
                    <p>The aim of the Certificate in Independent Review Engagements is to develop knowledge, understanding and application of the review engagement standard (ISRE 2400), the international standard on quality control (ISQC1) and the concepts and principles which underpin them.</p>
                    <p>The Certificate in Independent Review Engagements is a qualification which is flexible to your timetable, enabling you to fit your studies around your work and social commitments, and can be completed in a period of 4 months.</p>
                    <p>The prerequisite knowledge for the Certificate in Independent Review Engagements is a relevant degree and two yearsâ€™ experience in preparing working papers and issuing reports on financial statements.</p>
                    <p>This is an assessed course, which includes a multiple-choice examination which is recognised by the Southern African Institute of Business Accountants (SAIBA) for the purpose of obtaining a Practising Licence in Independent Review Engagements.</p>
                    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Obtaining the Certificate in Independent Review Engagements does not entitle you to perform independent review engagements. The independent review may only be performed by a person that is a member of a recognised professional body and who is qualified as an accounting officer. Professional bodies may also require such a person to obtain an additional qualification before issuing them with a licence to perform the independent review. The Certificate in Independent Review Engagements is recognised by a number of professional bodies for this purpose. Please ensure that your professional body accredits the Certificate in Independent Review Engagements before registering for the course. Accreditation is afforded in terms of an RPL policy.</p>
