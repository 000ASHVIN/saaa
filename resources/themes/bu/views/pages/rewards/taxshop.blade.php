                    <h3>Join the largest accounting and tax franchise in Southern Africa.</h3>
                    <p>Join our franchise to accelerate the performance of your accounting practice.</p>

                    <h4>Are you an accountant?</h4>                    
                    <p>Our focus is on establishing and expanding successful accounting and tax practices.  The Tax Shop franchise is ideal for bookkeepers, accountants, auditors, tax professionals and related practitioners.  It provides an excellent opportunity for new practices to establish themselves and for existing practices (no matter how small or large they may be) to expand.   We require franchisees to have a formal qualification in the accounting/tax fields and preferably to be a member of a recognised professional body.  We can also assist you to be registered with an approved professional body if you are not currently registered with one.</p>

                    <h4>What is the cost?</h4>
                    
                    <p>The current cost for a new franchise licence is R250,000.  <b>However, SAAA members receive a further 20% discount on this price - this equates to a massive R50,000 saving!</b> If you do not have finance available for the full amount please let us know and we will try our best to help you.  For example, we may arrange a repayment period for part of the amount and/or may be able to assist you with obtaining funding from a financial institution.</p>

                    <br>

                        The cost referred to above includes the following:  
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to trade in a zone agreed upon with you.</li>
                        <li>Start-up training at our head office (3 days in Pretoria) with all costs of transport, meals and accommodation included.</li>

                        <li>An initial marketing launch in your area e.g. newspapers adverts, social events, etc.  The purpose of this is to ignite your practice locally in a big way and to announce the launch of your practice.</li>
                        <li>Marketing material in the form of banners, flyers, business cards, corporate folders and brochures designed to kickstart your practice.</li>
                        <li>Personal mentoring on running your practice including input on marketing strategies which have been tested and proven historically.</li>

                        <li>Substantial discounts in many other areas.  The size of our group makes it possible to negotiate such discounts.  For example, professional indemnity insurance, which can cost tens of thousands of rands a year for a single practitioner will only cost a few hundred rands a year through us. Similarly, the cost of the online marketing course referred to above has been reduced from nearly R70,000 to less than R20,000 for our franchisees (the cost of this course is included in our franchise licence fee).</li>
                        <li>Unlimited email addresses and fax-to-email numbers.</li>
