<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
    We are living in uncertain times, within South Africa and globally.  As economic and political crises surround us, the business world is struggling and small and medium enterprises are battling with the challenges of doing more with less.  Small and medium accounting practices are feeling the trickle-down effects, as well as the threats of emerging technologies, which have the potential to render traditional book-keeping and compliance services obsolete.
</p>
<p>
    Practitioners must move with the times in order to stay afloat and seek innovative solutions for diversifying their offerings, keeping their clients and attracting new ones, cutting unnecessary costs, managing risk and achieving sustainable growth.  Now more than ever, it is crucial to develop strong practice management skills to support your business strategy, and to understand the business strategy of your clients in order to grow alongside them.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>3rd Annual Practice Management Conference for Accountants</strong>, brought to you by SA Accounting Academy, brings together small and medium-sized accounting practitioners, auditors, policymakers, industry bodies, financial institutions, advisory firms, technology providers and industry experts to explore the skills needed for achieving sound practice management in today’s challenging climate.
